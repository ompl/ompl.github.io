Welcome to the OMPL Blog. Here, we'll occasionally post messages about new and upcoming features in the Open Motion Planning Library. Not all these features will be prominently featured on the front page, so they might be easy to miss. In the near future, you can expect posts about: motion planning for Dubins and Reeds-Shepp cars, using the built-in numerical integration to plan for systems described by ordinary differential equations, and path optimization.
